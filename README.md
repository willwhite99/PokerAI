# PokerAI
A simple texas hold'em poker AI that makes use of Monte-Carlo tree search to find optimum and most likely results and bases its betting off that. However it may also bluff, otherwise the AI will never act unless it has a chance of winning.

It also makes use of the Chen formula, this is a simple math formula made by a Poker proffesional for valuing a starting pair, it also helps reduce computation for first hand.
